## My process
I decided to use bootstrap to help with spacing and the grid setup for the different columns. I started the project with the customized styles in css: background colors, font family, buttons, and hover states. I created a container for the 3 columns using bootstrap's container and then utilized grid to create 3 rows. I then added padding and margin to the headings, paragraphs, and buttons to match the design.

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
